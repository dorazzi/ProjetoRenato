  <h4>Essential Complexity (EC)</h4>

  <p><i>Description:</i></p>

  <p>The essential complexity, ev(G), of a method is calculated by first removing structured programming primitives from the method's control flow graph until the graph cannot be reduced any further, and then calculating the cyclomatic complexity, v(G), of the reduced graph.</p>

  <p>An immediate consequence is that 1 &lt;= ev(G) &lt;= v(G). A somewhat less obvious consequence, which can help when evaluating complexity analysis tools, is that ev(G) can never be equal to 2. This is because after all sequential nodes have been eliminated, the only graphs with v(G) equal to 2 are structured programming primitives,
